*** What Is Tuple ::-

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.   Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.


**** Difference Between List and Tuple  ------- 

                  Python Lists                                                                                                                                           Python Tuples

1           List are mutable                                                                                                                               Tuples are immutable

2          Iterations are time-consuming                                                                                                     Iterations are comparatively Faster

3          Inserting and deleting items is easier with a list.                                                                     Accessing the elements is best accomplished with                                                                                                                                                                              a tuple data type.

4         Lists consume more memory                                                                                                         Tuple consumes less than the list

5         Lists have several built-in methods.                                                                                             A tuple does not have many built-in methods                                                                                                                                                                             because of immutability

6         A unexpected change or error is more likely to occur in a list.                                            In a tuple, changes and errors don't usually occur                                                                                                                                                                             because of immutability.
